This is the recreation of classic game called Nu-Pogodi for Nfactorial.


The program is implemented through **index.html,** **nupogodi.css** and **wolf.js **as a web game.

The game has **4 difficulty levels:**

**Easy:** only 2 roads work - from opposite sides. If the punishment scores (shown as little chick in the top corner) are less than 1,5, then 1st and 3rd roads work, if greater, then vise versa

**Normal:** only 3 roads work - which road does not work depends on the punishment scores

**Standard:** all roads work, this level is similar with "GAME B" in the original game

**Extreme:** all roads work, the eggs more faster and spawn more frequently, ADDITIONAL: it has the "Freezer Eggs" that freezes the player for 1,5 sec

**Freezer Egg:**

The game has **a punishment system:**

When the player does not catch the egg, the player earns one punishment point (shown as chicken). When the punishment scores > 3, the player loses.
The rabbit helps to ease the punishment, when the egg drops in the presence of the rabbit, the player earns half of the punishment score (the chick icon blinks)

! The game also contains an easter egg - once the player reaches 990 score - the wolf says "Nu, Pogodi !" - a phrase of a character from the cartoon. It was recreated from the rumor, that when the player reaches the score 999, the "volk" says that phrase.

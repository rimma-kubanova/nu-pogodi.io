The game has 4 difficulty levels:

Easy: only 2 roads work - from opposite sides. If the punishment scores (shown as little chick in the top corner) are less than 1,5, then 1st and 3rd roads work, if greater, then vise versa

Normal: only 3 roads work - which road does not work depends on the punishment scores

Standard: all roads work, this level is similar with "GAME B" in the original game

Extreme: all roads work, the eggs more faster and spawn more frequently, ADDITIONAL: it has freeze eggs that freezes the player for 1,5 sec

Freezer Egg:


The game contains easter egg - once the player reaches 990 score - the wolf says "Nu, Pogodi !" - a phrase of a character from the cartoon

All characters, images, background were drawn by me
